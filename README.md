## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.JPG)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Learn about following Js CODE.


const fetchAdvice = async() => {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice")
    const data = await res.json()

    console.log(data)

    document.getElementById('id').innerHTML = data.slip.id;
    document.getElementById('advice').innerHTML = data.slip.advice;

}

fetchAdvice()
